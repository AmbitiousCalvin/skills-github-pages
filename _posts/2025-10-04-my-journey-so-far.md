Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I thought itâ€™d be cool to share a little bit about my coding journey up to this point. Itâ€™s been an exciting ride, and Iâ€™m only getting started, so hereâ€™s a quick recap of how I got here.

### How It All Started
It all began when I stumbled across **HTML/CSS**. I was curious about how websites were made, and I decided to try and build my own. At first, it felt overwhelming, but slowly, with some trial and error, I started to understand how things worked. There was something amazing about seeing a design come to life on the screen.

### Learning the Basics
Iâ€™m not a full-time developer yet â€” Iâ€™m still a student, learning part-time. But that hasnâ€™t stopped me from diving deep into the basics of **JavaScript** and front-end development. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I enjoy creating websites that not only function well but are also visually appealing.

Right now, I know just enough to build websites that look good and work smoothly. Iâ€™m still in the process of mastering the skills, and thereâ€™s a ton left to learn, but the journey so far has been incredibly fun.

### What's Next?
I'm not trying to rush it. Iâ€™m focusing on mastering the fundamentals â€” getting better at **JavaScript**, improving my **HTML/CSS** skills, and learning how to build beautiful, interactive websites that users love.

Even though Iâ€™m still a beginner, Iâ€™m excited about where this journey is taking me. Thereâ€™s always something new to learn, and I canâ€™t wait to see where my coding skills will go from here.
